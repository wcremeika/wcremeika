- 👋 Hi, I’m @wcremeika
- 👀 I’m interested in
  * :computer: Software engineering and development
  * :test_tube: Chemistry and biology (mostly about food)
  * :fried_egg: Cooking and baking (related to above)
  * :boxing_glove: Being active (includes a lot: running, lifting, basketball, boxing, anything really)
  * :video_game: Video games (Zelda, Assasin's Creed, Mario, and others...don't play as much as I used to, but enjoy from time to time)
  * :infinity: Mathematics (not good at it, but it interests me!)
- :brain: I’m currently learning
  * Github in-depth to help with devops
  * vuejs and corresponding ui frameworks (vuetify, bootstrap, etc...)
  * Technologies that correspond strongly with reporting and data analytics (R, python, and Power BI)  
    **Note:** Not so much the technologies, but the math/statistics piece and applications for them. More about solving problems than looking "smart".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure
- 📫 How to reach me ... will provide later
